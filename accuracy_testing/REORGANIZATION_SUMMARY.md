# Accuracy Testing Reorganization Summary

## New Directory Structure Created
- `/accuracy_testing/scripts/` - Contains all test runner scripts
- `/accuracy_testing/config/` - Contains test configuration files
- `/accuracy_testing/results/` - Contains test results

## Files Moved

### To `/accuracy_testing/scripts/`:
1. `run_baseline_test.py` - Baseline test runner
2. `run_accuracy_tests_simple.py` - Simple accuracy test runner
3. `run_accuracy_tests.py` - Main accuracy test runner
4. `automated_accuracy_test.py` - Automated accuracy testing
5. `test_retrieval_accuracy.py` - Retrieval accuracy tests
6. `test_system_integration.py` - System integration tests
7. `test_suite.py` - From `/tests/` directory
8. `test_pdf_upload.py` - PDF upload testing
9. `ingest_test_pdfs.py` - PDF ingestion testing
10. `debug_test.py` - Debug testing script
11. `simple_test.py` - Simple testing script
12. `quick_test.sh` - Quick test shell script
13. `quick_test_fixed.sh` - Fixed quick test shell script
14. `automated_test_runner.py` - From `/src/` directory

### To `/accuracy_testing/config/`:
1. `test_questions.json` - Test questions configuration

### To `/accuracy_testing/results/`:
1. `BASELINE_TEST_RESULTS.md` - Baseline test results
2. `baseline_results.txt` - Baseline results text file

### To `/docs/`:
1. `ACCURACY_TEST_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Implementation summary documentation

## Directories Removed
1. `/tests/` - Contained duplicate PDFs and was mostly empty
2. `/src_backup_20250712_212759/` - Old backup directory

## Notes
- All test-related files are now centralized in the `/accuracy_testing/` directory
- The organization follows a clear structure: scripts, configuration, and results
- No functional files were lost during the reorganization
