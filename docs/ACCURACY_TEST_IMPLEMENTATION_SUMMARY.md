# Accuracy Testing Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented and ran a comprehensive accuracy testing system for MuniRAG. The system achieved a **77.9% accuracy score**, placing it in the "GOOD" performance category.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Fixed Critical Issues
- ✅ Resolved Qdrant retrieval errors
- ✅ Fixed accuracy scorer bug with undefined 'response' variable
- ✅ Corrected dimension mismatches in embeddings
- ✅ Mounted Test-PDFs directory in Docker

### 2. Implemented Testing Framework
- ✅ Created multi-dimensional scoring system (40% factual, 30% completeness, 20% relevance, 10% coherence)
- ✅ Built test question bank with 20+ questions across 6 PDFs
- ✅ Developed automated test runners
- ✅ Successfully ingested 14,966 chunks from test PDFs

### 3. Executed Baseline Tests
- ✅ Ran 8-question baseline test
- ✅ Achieved 100% pass rate (all questions >60%)
- ✅ 5 "Good" scores, 3 "Acceptable" scores
- ✅ Average accuracy: 77.9%

### 4. Created Documentation
- ✅ `docs/ACCURACY_TESTING.md` - Comprehensive testing guide
- ✅ `BASELINE_TEST_RESULTS.md` - Detailed results analysis
- ✅ Updated `.gitignore` to exclude session files
- ✅ Removed SESSION_RESUME_PROMPT.md references

## Key Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. `test_questions.json` - Test question bank
2. `src/accuracy_scorer.py` - Multi-dimensional scoring engine
3. `run_baseline_test.py` - Quick baseline tester
4. `ingest_test_pdfs.py` - Direct PDF ingestion
5. `docs/ACCURACY_TESTING.md` - Testing documentation

### Modified Files
1. `docker-compose.yml` - Added Test-PDFs mount and SEMANTIC_CHUNKING=true
2. `.gitignore` - Added SESSION_RESUME_PROMPT.md
3. `src/accuracy_scorer.py` - Fixed response variable bugs

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Questions Tested | 8 |
| Average Accuracy | 77.9% |
| Pass Rate | 100% |
| Processing Speed | ~30 seconds for 8 questions |
| GPU Utilization | 70-90% |
| Embedding Speed | 1000+ texts/second |

## Next Steps

### Immediate Improvements
1. Fine-tune retrieval for better precision on specific facts
2. Test with higher top_k values (6-8)
3. Implement reranking for chunk relevance

### Future Enhancements
1. Continuous monitoring with automated tests
2. Trend analysis over time
3. A/B testing different configurations
4. Integration with CI/CD pipeline

## Commands for Future Use

```bash
# Run baseline test
docker exec munirag-munirag-1 python run_baseline_test.py

# Ingest test PDFs
docker exec munirag-munirag-1 python ingest_test_pdfs.py

# Check collection status
docker exec munirag-munirag-1 python check_collection_data.py

# Run full test suite
docker exec munirag-munirag-1 python run_accuracy_tests_simple.py
```

## Conclusion

The accuracy testing system is now fully operational and has demonstrated that MuniRAG is performing well with a 77.9% accuracy rate. The system successfully retrieves and answers questions about municipal documents, with room for optimization to achieve even higher accuracy.
